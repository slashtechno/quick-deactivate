# Quick deactivate

This is a Slack bot built for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a nonprofit
organization serving as both a community for high-school programmers, makers,
and hackers, but also as a resource hub providing grants and incentives, such as
free laptops, Flipper Zeros, and a lot [more](https://summer.hackclub.com/).\
These programs are <=18 bt we get many adults or people who want to defraud
these programs trying to joining. We quickly identify them, but deactivating
manually can get difficult as we need to deactivate more and more accounts. This
tool aims to automate that by allowing us to simply react to a message sent by
our existing verification infrastructure to quickly confirm the deactivation of
a user.
